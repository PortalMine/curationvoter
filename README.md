# curationvoter
curationvoter is a votebot for the steem platform written by me for backinblackdevil
It distributes vote to newly published posts. You can set black- and whitelists for authors and tags.
When voting you can simultaneously write a small comment to show your bot has voted.

I recommend to use [portalvotes](https://github.com/PortalMine/portalvotes) instead as it is further developed. This code stays here just for history.
